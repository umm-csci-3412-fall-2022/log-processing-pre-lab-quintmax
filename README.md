## Overview

The goal of this pre-lab is to help prepare us for the "Log processing lab". In particular we'll provide a set of potentially useful readings on particular topics that might be useful, and do three small exercises:

- [ ] Write a small "helper" shell script that will be useful when doing the lab itself.
- [ ] See how we can use that helper script to construct HTML/Javascript files that use the Google Charts tools to generate a nice graph.
- [ ] Create a _tag_ in `git`.
- [ ] Experiment a little with regular expressions.

The *pre-lab* is an *individual* project, but the lab will be done in pairs.
You should, again, create your repository through GitHub Classroom in that
repository.

**You will turn in _two things_ for this pre-lab:**

- The URL for your repository in whatever way the instructor requests
- The HTML file [described below](#make-a-sample-pie-chart-using-wrap_contentssh)

## Pre-lab readings and resources

Read the **entire** lab in advance (<https://github.com/UMM-CSci-Systems/Log-processing>) and definitely ask questions,
especially conceptual ones.

Below is a list of some key tools we'll use a lot in this lab. Some were covered in readings associated with the previous lab; others have links to potentially useful material that you should at least skim before lab.

- `bash` command line arguments. These were covered in some of the readings for the previous lab; [this tutorial](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/arguments-options-bash-scripts) also covers `bash` command line arguments specifically.
- `bash` loops. If loops in `bash` feel like they're from another world, it's really because they are. They rather betray their age and the fact that they're kinda "hacked in" to a tool (`bash`) that wasn't really built with full-on programming in mind. [This tutorial](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/bash-for-loop/) and [that tutorial](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/loops1.html) provide nice overviews and examples.
- `awk` is a very powerful Unix tool that can be used to automate loads of shell processes, but it takes some effort to learn. In many ways you'd probably rather use a modern scripting language like Ruby or Python, but `awk` is part of most any Unix installation, where you may not have Python or Ruby by default. You might find [this tutorial](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/01/awk-introduction-tutorial-7-awk-print-examples/) or [that tutorial](http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Awk.html) useful.
- `sed` (`s`tream `ed`itor) is another powerful, if old-school, standard Unix tools, that is particular useful doing "on-the-fly" editing of files or material coming through shell pipes. [this tutorial](http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html) or [that tutorial](http://www.panix.com/~elflord/unix/sed.html) might help.
- `grep` was used in the previous lab, but here are some more `grep` resources in case that's useful: [this tutorial](http://www.panix.com/~elflord/unix/grep.html) and [that tutorial](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix2.html)
- [Google's charting tools](http://code.google.com/apis/chart/) support a broad range of sophisticated chart styles and types. In this lab we'll use Google's charting tools to visualize logging information from our lab.
- [This tutorial on "Text processing commands"](http://linux.die.net/abs-guide/textproc.html) has a ton of info on the tools mentioned above along with others that will likely prove useful in the lab (e.g., `wc`, `head`, `sort`, etc.)

There's obviously vast oceans of information on line about all these tools, so feel free to search for other sources of info if these aren't working for you. You should do some background reading on these tools and try them out some before lab, though, so you don't spend all of the lab period Googling around for info on how to use these.

## Exercises

### Add Bats dependencies

:warning: **IMPORTANT** :warning: Because of a bug in GitHub's handling
of templates, your copy of the repository _will not work_ as it is. You'll
need to run three commands in the top level of the project to bring
in three different `bats` dependencies:

```bash
git submodule init

git submodule update
```

If you don't do this, or don't do it in the right place, etc., then your
Bats tests will almost certainly not run.

If you're still getting errors (e.g., it can't find a file), you
might try

```bash
  git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This frequently seems to fix mysterious `git` submodule problems.

### Write clean code

One of the badges at the top of this README is the result of running
`shellcheck` on all the shell scripts in this repository. It should be
green when you start the lab, and you want to keep it green as you
work through the lab. If you ever want to check a file by hand before
you commit or push your work, something like

```bash
shellcheck wrap_contents.sh
```

should do the trick.

### Write `wrap_contents.sh`

> We've set up GitHub Actions for the tests associated with this
> part of the lab, and the "Wrap tests" badge at the top of this
> README should (eventually) turn green when those tests pass.

In the full lab there are multiple occasions where we have some text that we want to wrap in a header and footer: The username distribution data is wrapped in its header and footer, the hours data is wrapped in its header and footer, the country distribution data is wrapped in its header and footer, and the combination of these texts is then wrapped in the overall header and footer. The script `wrap_contents.sh` is designed to automate this repeated process. It should take three arguments:

1. The name of the file containing the "contents" that need to be wrapped,
2. The name used to _specify_ the desired header and footer,
3. The name of the resulting file.

The second argument is a little odd because it's not an actual filename like the other two. It is instead the specifier for two filenames which are constructed by prepending the specifier to (a) `_header.html` and (b) `_footer.html`. So if the specifier is `frogs` then the header file will need to be `frogs_header.html` and the footer file will need to be `frogs_footer.html`. Only the specifier is provided as the second argument, and your script will need to construct those two file names from the provided specifier.

For example, this call:

```bash
./wrap_contents.sh gloop.txt bits target.html
```

will cause the contents of the file `gloop.txt` to be wrapped
between the contents of `bits_header.html` and the contents of
`bits_footer.html`, with the results being placed in `target.html`.
This assumes that `gloop.txt`, `bits_header.html`, and
`bits_footer.html` all exist (you _don't_ need to make them).  The
script should **overwrite** `target.html` if there was a file with
that name.

The actual joining of the files can be easily accomplished with `cat`. This should be a short little script; if you spend more than 15-20 minutes on it I would definitely start asking some questions. The trickiest part is probably forming the correct file names from the arguments you're given; curly braces might be useful there.

There is a simple set of tests in `wrap_tests.bats` that give you a sense of whether your implementation of `wrap_contents.sh` works.

### Make a sample pie chart using `wrap_contents.sh`

To give you an idea of what `wrap_contents.sh` will be used for in the lab, there are three files in the the `chart_example` directory in this repository:

- `meats.txt`
- `bread_header.html`
- `bread_footer.html`.

If you wrote your `wrap_contents.sh` script correctly, this call

```bash
../wrap_contents.sh meats.txt bread my_chart.html
```

should produce an HTML file called `my_chart.html` that, when loaded in your favorite browser, displays a pie chart indicating preferences for different sandwich meats. Generate that HTML file (`my_chart.html`) and **commit it as part of your repository**. **You'll also need to submit
that on Canvas along with the URL of your repository.**

The file `chart_example/sample_chart.html` is an example of the kind of thing you're looking to create, so you should be able to compare your work to that; `wrap_tests.bats` will do that automatically but you should probably check it yourself as well.

### Create a tag in `git`

Every commit in `git` gives you a "point in time" you can return to
by checking out that commit. This is important if, for example, a
customer calls up with a problem with version 2.7 which you released
back in March. You might have numerous other commits (including possible
bug fixes and the beginnings of new features) in the version on your
computer. So `git` allows you to `checkout` any commit, as a way of
travelling to that moment in time.

Unfortunately, the default IDs for commits (things
like `2f413425143cf11c6fd8c0b2baf1cdfb8153e24f`, or `2f41342` for short)
are hardly memorable.
Luckily, [`git` gives a way to _tag_ a particular commit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging)
with a string that will presumably be more readable or memorable.
We'll practice that here by creating a tag after you finish
the `wrap_contents.sh` part of the lab. (Don't worry if you did it
first or second, or interleaved the two parts, we'll just create a
tag whenever you finish the `wrap_contents.sh` part of the lab.)

To create a tag all you need to do is:

```bash
git tag -a <tag> -m <annotation>
```

where `<tag>` is the _tag name_ (often something like `v2.7`) and the
`<annotation>` is the tagging message, much like a commit message that
documents the creation of the tag. If you leave off the `-m <annotation>`
part, it will open up an editor and give you a chance to enter an
annotation there.

:memo: **For this part of the lab use the tag `finished-wrap-contents`.**
You can you any reasonable annotation message.

To see the info about a tag, the command `git show <tag>` (e.g.,
`git show v2.7`) will show you who made the tag and when, along with
the annotation message. So you can use `git show finished-wrap-contents`
to confirm that you've in fact made the desired tag.

We're not going to use it here, but there is also a way to connect tags
in `git` to _releases_ in GitHub. These can have additional information,
as well as file artifacts like ZIP files containing the contents of the
repository at that moment in time.

### Practice with regular expressions

_Regular expressions_ (or "regex" for short)
are an extremely important tool in
all software development, and they come up a _lot_ in systems
work and scripting. Like so many things, learning the most
commonly used 10% is 90% of the battle; few people
can use the more esoteric features without looking things up.

There are a _bunch_ of on-line resources to help you learn
to use regular expressions. A few that you might look
at include:

- [RegexOne.com](https://regexone.com) is a very nice, structured tutorial
  that takes you from the basics up through advanced usages
  in a nicely paced way.
- [RegexCrossword.com](https://regexcrossword.com) is fun if you like
  your learning
  in a more puzzle-oriented form. They provide a set of
  "crosswords" where the clues are regular expressions, and
  you have to figure out what letter fits in a box and
  satisfies the regexes for that cells row and column. The "Tutorial"
  puzzles introduce all the basic ideas, and then the others
  reinforce and expand on those. The advanced ones can be quite
  tricky.

As well as _learning_ tools like those above, there are also
some neat tools that allow you to just check that your
regexes are doing what you want. These are sometimes language
specific (more below), so be aware of what assumptions the
tool makes. Two widely used ones are
[regexr](http://regexr.com/) and
[Rubular](http://rubular.com/).

One nasty truth in the world, though, is that different
programming languages and shell tools (like `grep`) implement
different versions of regular expressions. Worse, often the
same tool (again, like `grep`) can handle different types of
regular expressions depending on what flags you give it.
`grep` in the lab, for example, currently supports at least
three different flavors of regex: `--basic-regexp`,
`--extended-regexp`, and `--perl-regexp`.

One place where this shows up in quite annoying ways is that
different regex implementations support different
"abbreviations" for common character classes. Pretty much
any regex system will let you use `[0-9]` to match any digit
from 0 to 9. Many (most?) will also let you use `\d` (where
'd' is for _digit_). But some require that you use the more
verbose (but perhaps more readable?) `[[:digit:]]`.

Similarly, another common character class is _words_, which
is in fact typically interpreted to be upper and lower case
letters _plus_ digits and underscore. (So it's actually
characters that can appear in variable names in most
imperative programming languages.) You could just write that
out as a character class, `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`, but many systems
also support the `\w` abbreviation that means the same thing.
The POSIX scheme gives us `[[:alpha:]]`, which is `[a-zA-Z]`
and `[[:alnum:]]`, which is `[a-zA-Z0-9]`, but nothing that
is exactly what `\w` since `alnum` doesn't include the
underscore.

**Many tools support the `-E` flag**, which gives you _extended_
regular expressions. This provides most of the goodies you typically
want, so that's a good thing to try if your tool (.e.g., `grep` or
`sed`) doesn't seem to be handling regexes in the way you expected.

Sigh – history is complicated, even in computer science.

```english
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```

Another nasty truth of the world is that most regex code is
"write only" in the sense that it's really tough to read and
understand. People often "hack around" until they get their
regular expressions to work, and then no one ever really
reads or understands them afterwards.

That makes regular expressions a place where comments can
really help. In some circumstances you can also do things like
give names to parts of a regular by assigning them to variables,
although that's not easy in `bash` scripts.

#### Regex examples

To illustrate these differences, imagine we have an input
file `r0_input.txt` that contains

```english
* KK, muffins
* Nic, donuts
* Vincent, juice
```

and we want to match and print out the name and
breakfast snack in the form:

```english
1. KK
2. muffins

1. Nic
2. donuts

1. Vincent
2. juice
```

Here are several solutions, some using `sed` and some using `awk`. The `sed` solutions both require the `-E` flag, or
you don't get the group matching (the `\1` in the "output"
part of the match). You can use `[[:alpha:]]` in `sed`, but
you can't use `\w`.

In the first two examples we use `([a-zA-Z]+)` (in the first one)
and `([[:alpha:]]+)`
in the second to match the name and the (one word) breakfast snack.
The parentheses allow us to "capture" what matches, and then
"reprint" it using `\1` and `\2`.

```bash
sed -E 's/\* ([a-zA-Z]+), ([a-zA-Z]+)/1. \1\n2. \2\n/' < r0_input.txt
```

```bash
sed -E 's/\* ([[:alpha:]]+), ([[:alpha:]]+)/1. \1\n2. \2\n/' < r0_input.txt
```

`awk` doesn't directly support group matching in its
regular expression clause, but we can use the `match` function
to capture matches and put them in an array so we can access
them later. `awk` (actually `gawk`, which is what `awk`
defaults to in our lab) does allow `\w`, as well as `:alpha:`.

Here an expression like

```awk
match($0, /([a-zA-Z]+), ([a-zA-Z]+)/, groups)
```

will try to match the whole line (`$0`) against the regex
`([a-zA-Z]+), ([a-zA-Z]+)`. The parentheses again creates groups,
but here they go into an array that we name in the third argument
to `match`. We called it `groups` here, but you could call it
`frogs` or whatever. Then you can access those in the associated
action (e.g., `groups[2]` or `frogs[2]`).

```bash
awk 'match($0, /([a-zA-Z]+), ([a-zA-Z]+)/, groups) {print "1. " groups[1] "\n" "2. " groups[2] "\n" }' < r0_input.txt
```

```bash
awk 'match($0, /(\w+), (\w+)/, groups) {print "1. " groups[1] "\n" "2. " groups[2] "\n" }' < r0_input.txt
```

```bash
awk 'match($0, /([[:alpha:]]+), ([[:alpha:]]+)/, groups) {print "1. " groups[1] "\n" "2. " groups[2] "\n" }' < r0_input.txt
```

#### Regex Exercises

> There's a GitHub Action set up for these tests as well, with
> a corresponding badge up at the top of the README.

In the `regex` folder there are three input files:

- `r0_input.txt`
- `r1_input.txt`
- `r2_input.txt`

You should write a script `regex.sh` (in the folder `regex`)
that uses a tool like
`sed` or `awk` and regular expressions to extract the desired
content and output it as displayed below. In each case the
output should go in a file with the name `r0_output.txt`,
`r1_output.txt`, and `r2_output.txt`, respectively.
(And yes, we basically did one for you.)

##### Regex 0

**Input:**

```english
* KK, muffins
* Nic, donuts
* Vincent, juice
```

**Output:**

```english
1. KK
2. muffins

1. Nic
2. donuts

1. Vincent
2. juice
```

##### Regex 1

**Input:**

```english
* I am KK. My favorite sandwich is turkey.
* I am Nic. My favorite sandwich is avocado.
* I am awesome. I love puppies, but I don't like sandwiches.
* I am Vincent. My favorite sandwich is ham.
```

**Output:**

```english
1. KK
2. turkey

1. Nic
2. avocado

1. Vincent
2. ham
```

##### Regex 2

**Input:**

```english
* sandwich with turkey.bacon.swiss. for here
* sandwich with ham.cheddar. to go
* sandwich with tunaSalad. to go
```

**Output:**

```english
1. turkey.bacon.swiss.
2. for here

1. ham.cheddar.
2. to go

1. tunaSalad.
2. to go
```
